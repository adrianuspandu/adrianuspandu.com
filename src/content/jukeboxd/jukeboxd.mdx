## Overview

Everyone loves music. I guess it's safe to say that the statement is no longer an opinion but more of a fact. In today's world, where streaming services are common, we have so many options that it can sometimes be difficult to have a focused music-listening experience.

Jukeboxd allows users to rate and review albums, add albums to their "Want to Listen" list, and keep up with new album releases. You can [try the web app](https://jukeboxd-two.vercel.app/) for yourself or visit the website's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adrianuspandu/jukeboxd).

The idea for this project comes from my interest in music and my struggle to enjoy it in an increasingly distracting world. I'm also a regular [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) user, which inspired the name Jukeboxd (not very creative, I know).

I am aware of existing music/album tracker websites like [RateYourMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com) and [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), but I wanted to create a similar app using the [React Router Library](https://reactrouter.com/) and the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) for this project.

## Design Process

Before I started development, I wanted a clear design to follow. I aimed for a simple and intuitive interface and came up with the idea of placing a prominent search bar at the center of the homepage.

I also wanted to learn React Router, so I decided to create a navigation bar where users can navigate between four main pages: Home, New Releases, My Albums, and About.

### Wireframes

Wireframing is very useful for generating ideas. Normally, I sketch wireframes by hand because it helps me quickly express random thoughts without distractions. However, for efficiency, I decided to create them directly in Figma. Wireframing allowed me to draft layouts quickly without worrying about discarding them if they didn't solve the problem.

During this process, I decided that album covers should be the focal point. I wanted them to be high in the visual hierarchy, making them large to mimic the feeling of browsing for albums in a record store.

### Mock

After finalizing the wireframes, I applied colors and typography to the design. I kept things simple and clean by using a sans-serif font and generated a color palette using [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com). I've used this tool so much that I feel like I'm over-relying on it—but if you struggle with color theory like I do, I highly recommend checking it out!

At this stage, I also realized the importance of designing empty states—for example, when a user hasn't added anything to their list or when the Spotify API fails to return search results.

## Developing The App

Now comes the fun part—bringing the website to life. Below, I'll break down the technologies I used and explain them in a simple way.

### React Router 7

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is a popular library for managing navigation in React applications. It allows me to create routes using the built-in `<Route>` and `<Routes>` components. Here's a code snippet showing how I used React Router in my website:

```javascript
const router = createBrowserRouter(
  createRoutesFromElements(
    <Route path="/" element={<RootLayout />}>
      <Route index element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="new-releases" element={<NewReleases />} />

      <Route path="my-albums" element={<MyAlbumsLayout />}>
        <Route index element={<ReviewedAlbums />} />
        <Route path="want-to-listen" element={<WantToListenAlbums />} />
      </Route>

      <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
      <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
    </Route>
  )
);
```

### Tailwind CSS v4.0

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that lets me style Jukeboxd using pre-built classes instead of writing custom CSS. Here's a comparison of traditional CSS and Tailwind:

#### Traditional CSS

```css
.edit-button {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-top: auto;
  padding: 2px 6px;
  background-color: var(--primary);
  font-weight: bold;
  color: var(--background);
  border-radius: 2px;
}
```

#### Tailwind CSS

```jsx
<button className="ml-auto mt-auto px-1.5 py-0.5 bg-primary font-bold text-background rounded-sm">
  Edit Review
</button>
```

At first, I thought Tailwind CSS went against the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle since you have to write styles for every component. But after using it, I found it surprisingly convenient. Instead of managing long CSS files, I could build components quickly without worrying about unused styles cluttering my codebase.
With Tailwind, every interface component is easily disposable, making development more efficient and flexible.

### Vite

[Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a modern tool for building web apps, especially since I use React as my main library. It's faster than traditional bundlers like Webpack because Vite only refreshes the parts of the app that change. I also chose it because the setup is very simple for someone who's not particularly hacky.

## Room for Improvements

Since this project originally served as an opportunity for me to learn React Router and Tailwind CSS, there are a few things I'd like to improve in the future when I have the time. Here are some areas that could use enhancement:

- Currently the app uses localStorage to store reviewed albums. I'd like to implement Firestore authentication and integrate Firestore database functionality into the app.
- I'd like to replace the "New Releases" page with one that shows personalized recommendations based on users' reviewed albums.
- Since [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) was introduced in Next.js 13, I think it would be easier to migrate this project into
  a Next.js framework. (I'm a big fan of App Router)
